## Insights & Recommendations

### Key Insights (example)
- Profit is not always highest where sales are highest (some products/regions have low margins).
- A few products drive a large share of profit (focus on “top profit” items).
- Some categories show strong revenue but weak profit → indicates discounting or high cost.

### Business Recommendations (example)
- Promote high-profit products more (bundles, homepage placement, email campaigns).
- Investigate low-margin categories: pricing, supplier cost, and discount strategy.
- Focus marketing spend on regions with high profit margin, not just high sales.
- Reduce/stop discounts on products that are high sales but negative profit.
